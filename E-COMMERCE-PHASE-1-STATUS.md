## ⚠️ NEXT STEPS - YOU MUST DO THIS

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor, run:
glowing-legacy/supabase/migrations/20251031120000_create_products_table.sql
```

This creates the `products` and `product_variants` tables.

### Step 2: Seed Products
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor, run:
glowing-legacy/supabase/seed-products.sql
```

This populates your database with 11 sample products.

### Step 3: Test the Shop
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/shop`
3. Try adding products to cart
4. Click cart button (top right) to open drawer
5. Test quantity adjustments
6. Test remove item
7. Test category filters

### Step 4: Report Any Errors
If you see any errors in:
- Browser console
- Terminal
- Network requests (check DevTools Network tab)

Copy and paste them here so I can fix them immediately.

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
```
User clicks "Add to Cart" 
  → addToCart() in cart context
  → Update cart state
  → Save to localStorage
  → Auto-open cart drawer
  → Display updated cart with totals
```

### Cart State Management
```typescript
{
  items: CartItem[],      // Products with quantities
  subtotal: number,       // Sum of all items
  tax: number,            // 8% of subtotal
  shipping: number,       // $0 for now (calculated at checkout)
  total: number           // subtotal + tax + shipping
}
```

### Product Categories
- **keepsake** - Memory boxes, frames, albums
- **memorial** - Memorial stones, plaques
- **jewelry** - Pendants, bracelets with engraving
- **package** - Bundled deals (video credits + physical items)
- **digital** - Video credits, storage subscriptions

### Cart Persistence
- Stored in localStorage under key: `'glowing-legacy-cart'`
- Survives page refreshes
- Cleared on checkout completion (to be implemented)
