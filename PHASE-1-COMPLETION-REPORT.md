> - Code is clean, typed, and follows best practices
> - All bugs from the Vercel build have been fixed"

### ❌ **What You HAVE NOT Done (Future Phases):**

> "Phase 1 is a functional UI prototype with working authentication. The following major features still need implementation:
> 
> **Phase 2 Work Needed (Est. 20-30 hours):**
> - ❌ Stripe payment integration (checkout flow, webhooks, credit system)
> - ❌ Video recording backend (upload, storage, processing)
> - ❌ Email/SMS delivery system (Resend/Twilio integration)

### 📊 **Current State:**

```
Phase 1: Frontend + Auth     [████████████████████] 100% ✅
Phase 2: Core Features        [░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]   0% ⏳
Phase 3: Advanced Features    [░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]   0% ⏳
```

### 💡 **Honest Assessment:**

**Can Users:**
- ✅ Sign up and create an account? **YES**
- ✅ Log in and access dashboard? **YES**
- ✅ See all pages and UI? **YES**
- ❌ Purchase video credits? **NO** (Stripe not integrated)
- ❌ Record and save videos? **NO** (backend not implemented)
- ❌ Send packages? **NO** (e-commerce backend not done)
- ❌ Schedule deliveries? **NO** (delivery system not built)

**In Summary:**
This is a **high-fidelity interactive prototype** with working authentication. It demonstrates the full user experience flow, but payment processing and core backend features need ~20-30 hours more work before it's production-ready for real users.
