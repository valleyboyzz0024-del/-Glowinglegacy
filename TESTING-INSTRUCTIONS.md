- Tax (8%): $26.40
- Shipping: $0.00 (or "Calculated at checkout")
- **Total: $356.37**

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Products don't load
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify migration ran successfully
- Check Network tab for failed /api/products request

### Issue: Images don't display
**Solution:**
- Normal! Unsplash URLs may have CORS issues in dev
- Images will work in production

### Issue: Cart doesn't persist
**Solution:**
- Check localStorage in DevTools
- Look for key: 'glowing-legacy-cart'
- Verify localStorage isn't disabled

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution:**
- Already fixed! Should compile clean now
