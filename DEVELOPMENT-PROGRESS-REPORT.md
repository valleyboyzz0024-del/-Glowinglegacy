#### 8. Critical Tailwind CSS Fix
**Problem:** Site was completely unstyled (white background, no custom colors)

**Root Cause:** Duplicate PostCSS config files causing Tailwind to fail loading

**Solution:**
1. Deleted `postcss.config.mjs`
2. Created proper `postcss.config.js` with `module.exports`
3. Updated `tailwind.config.ts` colors to use `<alpha-value>` pattern
4. Cleared `.next` cache and rebuilt

**Result:** ✅ All custom styling working perfectly - black background, gold accents, professional look

**Time Saved:** This fix prevented potentially hours of debugging later.

**Why This Matters:** Brand consistency across all touchpoints. Builds trust and professionalism.

---

### PART 4: Authentication System (2 hours)

#### 12. Initial Authentication Issues
**Problems Encountered:**
1. RLS policy blocking new user signups
2. Email confirmation links failing with "invalid path" error
3. Build failing due to Supabase client initialization
4. ESLint errors preventing deployment

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Manual user profile insert violating security policies
2. Missing `/auth/callback` route for email confirmations
3. Supabase clients created at build-time vs runtime
4. Unescaped apostrophes in JSX

---

#### 13. Authentication Fixes Implemented

**Fix 1: Database Trigger for User Profiles**
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251031_auto_create_user_profile.sql`

Created automatic user profile creation trigger:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION handle_new_user() 
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, full_name, created_at)
  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email, 
          COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.email),
          NEW.created_at);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Why This Matters:** Supabase best practice. Secure, automatic, reliable.

---

**Fix 2: Email Confirmation Callback**
**File:** `app/auth/callback/route.ts` (15 lines)

Created route to handle email confirmation redirects:
```typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const code = requestUrl.searchParams.get('code');
  if (code) {
    await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code);
  }
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/onboarding', requestUrl.origin));
}
```

**Why This Matters:** Email confirmation now works. Users can verify their accounts.

---

**Fix 3: Build Error Resolution**

Changed from build-time to runtime client initialization:

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
```

**After (WORKING):**
```typescript
function getSupabaseAdmin() {
  const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
  const supabaseServiceKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;
  
  if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseServiceKey) {
    throw new Error('Missing Supabase environment variables');
  }
  
  return createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceKey);
}
```

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/api/videos/upload/route.ts`
- `app/dashboard/record/page.tsx`

**Why This Matters:** Vercel builds now succeed. App deploys without errors.

---

**Fix 4: Supabase Configuration**

**Problem:** Redirect URLs weren't configured in Supabase Dashboard

**Solution:** Manually configured in Supabase:
- Site URL: `https://www.glowinglegacy.com`
- Redirect URLs:
  - `https://www.glowinglegacy.com/auth/callback`
  - `https://glowinglegacy.vercel.app/auth/callback`

**Why This Matters:** Email confirmation links now redirect correctly.

---
