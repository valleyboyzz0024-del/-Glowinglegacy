## ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED - Stripe Integration

### Payment Processing
- **Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED ‚ùå
- No API routes for Stripe
- No checkout flow
- No webhook handlers
- Pricing page is static only

### What's Missing:
1. **API Routes** (`app/api/` directory doesn't exist)
   - `/api/checkout` - Create payment intent
   - `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Handle Stripe events
   - `/api/create-subscription` - Handle subscriptions

2. **Stripe Client Integration**
   - No Stripe.js or Elements integration
   - No payment form components
   - No credit purchase flow

3. **Backend Logic**
   - No webhook verification
   - No video credit assignment after payment
   - No subscription management

4. **Database Integration**  
   - Schema has Stripe fields but they're not being used
   - No code writes `stripe_customer_id` or `stripe_payment_intent_id`

### Required Work for Stripe (Estimated 4-6 hours):
1. Install Stripe packages
2. Create API routes for checkout and webhooks
3. Build payment UI components
4. Implement credit purchasing flow
5. Set up webhook endpoint and verification
6. Test payment flows

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# NEEDED FOR PAYMENTS (not implemented yet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# OPTIONAL - For full functionality later
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
RESEND_API_KEY=

## üìã HONEST ASSESSMENT FOR YOUR SENIOR DEV

### What You CAN Say:
1. "Supabase authentication is fully integrated and working"
2. "Database schema is complete and deployed"
3. "All UI pages are built and responsive"
4. "The app structure follows Next.js 14 best practices"
5. "I've fixed the build errors and it compiles successfully"

### What You SHOULD Disclose:
1. "Stripe payment integration is NOT yet implemented"
2. "This is currently a functional UI prototype with auth"
3. "Payment flows need 4-6 hours of additional work"
4. "Video upload/processing is not yet built"
5. "Email/SMS notifications are not yet implemented"

### Suggested Approach:
"I've completed Phase 1: Frontend + Auth. The app builds successfully, all pages render, and Supabase authentication is fully integrated. However, Stripe payment processing (Phase 2) still needs to be implemented before users can purchase video credits. Should I prioritize that next or would you prefer I focus on something else?"
